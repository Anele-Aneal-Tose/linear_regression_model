# Linear_Regression_Model
___

## 1. Details about Project

### Project setup steps
___
#### Step 1:
I installed rust in my Ubuntu 22.04 computer using the following command on the terminal "
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh". After that I followed few steps until I successfully installed rust and cargo was also included on the installation.

#### Step 2:
Secondly, I installed Rustrover IDE using "snap install".

#### Step 3:
I first created a directory for my project on desktop using the command on Ubuntu terminal "cd Desktop", and then I created a cargo new project using the following command "cargo new linear_regression_model" and the project was created successfully. I opened the project on Rustrover using the following command on the terminal "rustrover .".

#### Step 4:

I then build the project using the following command "cargo build". After that I ran few commands like "cargo run" and "cargo check" to check if the project was running successfully.

#### Step 5:

On this step I copied and pasted the given cargo.toml file into the project. I also created a .gitignore file, and a README.md file.

#### Step 6:

This is the development step of the project using rust source code........
### Explanation about project approach
___
My first approach to this project was to first to get a bit of understanding about rust as a programming language, so I had to check for some good books online about rust. My next approach was to visit a rust website, I read the documentation about rust, and also checked out some good Yotube videos. I then went on and install all the required tools to run rust and from that point I had a bit of understing about rust so I approached Chatgtp for some code to build a model.
### Challenges faced
___
I faced a lot of challenges trying to install Rust and Rustrover in my pc but I ended up winning. I also faced some challenges with the cargo.toml file, it was giving errors but I ended up accomplishing that step. Another challenge that I encountered is when the project wasn't running.
### Resources used
___
I used chatgtp to generate some code for me because Rust is a new language to me. I also used Yotube, Rust website, Rust text book, StackOverFlow, and Rust documentation.
## 2. Reflection on my learning
___

### How much help received from AI
___
I generated most of the code using ChartGtp,and Copilot. I also got some help from Yotube videos and from the book called "THE RUST PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE, 2ND EDITION.
2023 by the Rust Foundation and the Rust Project Developers." I also got extensive help from Rust website and documentation.
### Failed to solve the problem
___
I failed to make the program run because I had issues with the dependancy file, and secondly I was struggling with the imports, they where giving me problems. Furthermore, because of the fact that i'm new to Rust I couldn't get a clear picture of what is realy happening with my code, but from now on I have a small idea of the Rust syntax. When I look to all the resources I used, I can say that Rust is a fast growing language, and I've learned that its capable of doing most of the tasks. From now on I'm going to spend sometime learning more about this language.
